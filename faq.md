# 加密球星常见问题

## 了解加密球星

**什么是加密球星?**

加密球星是一款新的数字资产交易游戏。你能够通过收集，交换获得稀有体育类收藏卡牌。每张球员卡牌都100%归你所有，不可被复制，夺走或者销毁。

**加密球星怎么玩?**

在加密球星中，你的目标是完整收集两套原创和标志性球员卡牌。如果在2018年7月20日之前你完整收集了两套或其中一套卡牌，你将获得丰厚奖励。

原创和标志性球员卡牌可以通过卡包购买（一个卡包含有4张球员卡），也可以通过市场或者与其他玩家交换获得。一套完整的原创卡牌有100张，而完整的标志性卡牌有32张。

标志性卡牌不能通过自有卡包开出。但你可以通过高级卡包获得。高级卡包中的标志性球员自2018年6月14日起，每天轮换，共有24个标志球员卡。另外的8张则通过邀请返利活动获得或者通过市场购买。

截止2018年7月16日，卡包将不再出售。但玩家仍可以随时通过市场继续购买或者出售卡牌。

**玩加密球星需要花钱吗?**

是的。除好友赠予外，你需要花费以太币（ETH）购买球员卡牌。

**玩加密球星需要拥有多少球员卡?**

入门加密球星只需要一张卡牌就可以。但是我们建议你通过购买卡包来完成球员卡牌套装的收集。

**W加密球星有什么特别的地方?**

加密球星基于以太坊研发。你可以像传统收藏品一样，购买，出售或者交换你的加密球星卡牌。以太坊区块链会确保你对卡牌的所有权。所有与游戏相关的交易和操作都是可验证的。

区块链技术使得加密收藏品，如加密球星卡牌得以产生，并解决了传统卡牌交易系统存在的问题：

* 真正的数字化所有权：你的对任意加密收藏品的所有权和转让，在以太坊区块链上都是透明且可追溯的。
* 可验证的稀缺性：道具的供给和稀有度由不可变更的去中心化分布式记账系统保证，而不能由任何中心化的团体任意创造。
* 去信任交易：加密收藏品由智能合约而不是任何中心化公司控制。因为加密收藏品的本质是可转让的，所以它们能够在封闭经济系统之外进行交易。由此增加了全球流动性。
* 延展性：加密球星卡牌不依赖于加密球星网站。它们可以在其他市场和应用中进行交易。你可以随时将卡牌发送或交易给任何人。

**加密球星的宗旨是什么?**

加密的前锋的宗旨是将区块链技术的价值提供给玩家。为玩家带来前所未有的体验，重新定义数字化所有权，并鼓励玩家参与去中心化的全球经济系统。

## 开始游戏

**玩加密球星我需要准备什么?**

你需要准备以下东西：

(1) 电脑或者笔记本用户：请安装谷歌、火狐、Opera或者Brave浏览器。手机用户：请对应下载iOS或安卓版Toshi、Cipher浏览器，或者Trust钱包。
(2) 然后安装MetaMask钱包。
(3) 准备好以太币。

**安装 MetaMask, 你的数字钱包**

我们只能将卡包发放到Meta钱包上（其他应用，请查阅下文教程）。加密球星不支持Coinbase和Binance等交易所钱包。

你的数字钱包将作为你在加密球星的登录方式。在进行任何购买之前，你需要先往你的MetaMask中转入一定的以太币。

注意: MetaMask钱包相当于你的银行账账户 - 请妥善保管好你的密码和助记词。一旦丢失，加密球星将无法帮你找回。

以下是如何安装MetaMask的详细教程。如果你更喜欢视频教程，请点击以下图片观看。

**为什么我的MetaMask钱包被锁住了?**

每隔一段时间MetaMask钱包会自动锁住你的账户。你只需要点击MetaMask钱包，输入密码即可解锁。

**重新安装MetaMask钱包**

如果你需要重新安装MetaMask钱包，请按照以下步骤：删除MetaMask扩展程序，重新下载安装，导入助记词。 然后设置密码（新密码可以和旧密码一致）并在加密球星的网站上重新确认邮箱和昵称。

**什么是以太币（ETH)？为什么玩加密球星要用到以太币?**

以太币是以太坊网络发行的数字货币，用于支持以太坊的发展。而加密球星正是基于以太坊开发。

你需要将你的法币兑换成以太币来购买游戏内的球员卡牌和其他道具。

**获取以太币**

**_仅针对美国玩家:_** 

你可以在加密球星的网页上通过MetaMask购买以太币。通过手机钱包登录加密球星的玩家，或是不想通过Coinbase购买以太币的玩家，请查阅以下教程。

**_其他地区的玩家:_**  你需要通过交易所购买以太币，然后转入你的MetaMask钱包中。很遗憾，你不能直接使用交易所账号进入游戏。

你不能使用法币在加密球星网站上直接购买球员卡片。请先将法币兑换成以太币。

**如何将以太币转入MetaMask?**

仅针对美国玩家：你可以在加密球星的网站上通过MetaMask钱包直接使用Coinbase购买以太币，而无需重新创建一个新的账号。购买到以太币将会在余额中显示。通过手机钱包登录加密球星的玩家，或是不想通过Coinbase购买以太币的玩家，请查阅以下教程将以太币转入MetaMask。

其他地区的玩家：你可以在交易所用法币购买够以太币。第一步复制你的钱包地址（点击账号旁边的复制按钮）。然后登陆交易所，点击账户，然后选中以太币账户，点击发送。最后将复制的MetaMask地址粘贴进去，填写金额即可。

**什么是Gas?**

Gas 翻译成中文就是“燃气”，是以太坊世界的燃料，它决定了以太坊网络生态系统的正常运行。

Gas 用来衡量执行某些动作需要多少“工作量”，这些“工作量”就是为了执行该动作支付给网络的费用额。

Gas费用通常用gwei 来表示 (1百万gwei = 1 ether/ETH).

了解更详细说明，[请参阅概述] (https://ethgas.io).

**什么时候需要付Gas费用?**

对于每一项纪录在区块链上的交易，你都要付Gas费。就游戏内而言，这些交易包括，购买卡牌，出售卡牌，赠送卡牌和领取奖励。

**为什么玩加密球星这么复杂?**

加密球星使用了区块链技术，基于以太坊运行。相对而言这是一项新的技术，很多地方还不完善，因此显得相对复杂。相信等以太坊发展成熟，会给玩家带来更好的游戏体验。

## Buying and selling

**How do I buy CryptoStrikers cards?**

Cards can be bought in packs of 4 by going to the ‘Buy Cards’ link. Cards can be bought individually by going to the ‘Marketplace’ and purchasing cards directly from other users.

**What are the different type of card packs offered for purchase?**

‘Original’ set cards can be bought via Standard packs using Ether (‘Normal Sale’) or through exchanging a CryptoKitty (‘Exchange Sale’). Iconics cards are available via inserts in ‘Premium’ pack purchases with Ether (‘Premium Sale’). Iconics cards are available on a limited time basis - 1 day max only - and their schedule is announced daily starting on June 14, 2018.

**How do I find out which Iconics card is available in a Premium Sale?**

Check the Buy Packs page often or keep any eye out for announcements via email, and our social accounts, [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptostrikers), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CSBBBb).

**How do I sell CryptoStrikers cards?**

Currently, click the OpenSea link in the Marketplace tab - each of your cards are listed on OpenSea. You can see them by clicking your Account. Click one of the cards you own, and you will see a Sell button to start an auction.

In the future, CryptoStrikers will launch its own marketplace. There, when you click one of the cards that you own, there will be a button to ‘Sell’ your card on the Card Detail page. 

**Can I list multiple cards in a single sale offer?**

No, we do not support that functionality at this time.

How much does it cost to buy a CryptoStrikers pack or card?
Standard packs are priced in the ETH equivalent of US$15/pack, while Premium packs are priced in the ETH equivalent of US$30/pack

There’s no standard price for an individual card. Users set their own selling price when they sell a given card.

**Are there any limitations on buying a pack with a CryptoKitty?**

There are 1,000 packs that may be bought with a CryptoKitty. No such sales will be allowed once this supply runs out. Each user is limited to one such purchase. Any owned CryptoKitty associated with your MetaMask wallet address may be used to make this purchase.

**What should I do if my card isn’t selling?**

Pricing for individual cards will be determined by supply and demand. If your card isn’t selling, you can reduce the sale price at any time or cancel the sale and wait to put the card back on market at a later date. Consider reviewing current market prices for player cards when determining what sale price to set. 

**What is the fee to sell my cards on CryptoStrikers?**

We do not take any fees from sales transactions on our marketplace. Note that it’s possible to do whatever you want with your card outside of our marketplace without paying us anything. If you do decide to sell your cards on marketplaces outside of CryptoStrikers, please check out any fees before creating a sale listing.

**Can I cancel a sale listing that I’ve created?**

Yes. To cancel a sale listing, go to your Activity Feed, locate the sale transaction you wish to cancel, then click ‘Cancel’ button next to the transaction. Creating a sale is a transaction on the blockchain, so you must pay gas to cancel the sale. Your card is only returned to you if your cancel order is processed prior to another user’s buy order being processed.

## Trading

**How do I create a trade offer?**

Go to the Trade Center. If you know the wallet address of your trading partner, enter it in the field provided. Pick a player card that you own and wish to trade. If you’ve entered your trading partner’s wallet info, you will be able to choose from one of the cards that user owns. If not, you can select one of the cards available in any collection that you wish to acquire. Once you click ‘submit’ and the transaction has been mined/recorded on the blockchain, your offer will be officially created.

**How do I share my trade offer with others?**

Once you ‘submit’ your trade offer, you will receive a ‘trade offer link’. You can then share this URL wherever and however you like - via email, text, social media posts, messenger apps, etc. When a prospective trading partner navigates to your trade offer URL, they will see your offer on a unique page and can accept it from that location.

**How can I find trading partners?**

You can post a message on our [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptostrikers) or our #trading channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CSBBBb) to find trading partners. You can also contact people you know directly through whatever communication method you prefer.

**How do I accept a trade offer that I’ve received from another user?**

Click the trade offer link, and you will be directed to a unique page that will display the cards in the proposed trade. You can then click the ‘Accept’ button to execute the trade. 

**Can I cancel a trade offer that I’ve created?**

Yes. To cancel a trade offer, go to your Activity Feed, locate the trade offer you wish to cancel, then click ‘Cancel’ button next to the transaction. Creating a trade is a transaction on the blockchain, so you must pay gas to cancel the sale. Your card is only returned to you if your cancel order is processed prior to another user’s trade acceptance being processed.

**Why can’t I create trades with multiple players?**

That functionality is not set up in the initial release of CryptoStrikers. It is a feature that we’d like to offer in a future iteration of the game. (Do you have other ideas on features we should offer? Please contact us at feedback@cryptostrikers.com or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CSBBBb) channel.)

## Other

**Are CryptoStrikers cards like Bitcoin?**

CryptoStrikers cards are not a cryptocurrency nor are they a token affiliated with an ICO. They’re what is commonly referred to as a ‘cryptocollectible’. The real-world analogy for a cryptocurrency is dollars or pounds; a cryptocollectible real world analogy is closer to assets like baseball cards.

As programmed and managed by smart contracts, any CryptoStrikers card that you own belongs to you. The price of any card is determined by market demand, scarcity, and your asking price.

**Why can’t I see my sale on Etherscan?**

Payments for sales are called “internal transactions” on Etherscan. These transactions are listed on their own tab.

**Is this a scam?**

No, this isn’t a scam. Our two person CryptoStrikers team is not allowed to directly participate in this game. We have also installed safeguards wherever possible to limit manipulation by bad actors.

**Can I use a Credit Card to play CryptoStrikers?**

No, the technology isn’t available yet to support credit card transactions.. However, most exchanges do let you buy Ether with a credit card.

**Can I play CryptoStrikers with my phone?**

Yes. While we have not launched a native mobile app at this time, you can play CryptoStrikers on a mobile phone via the Cipher Browser, Toshi, or Trust Wallet available on iOS or Android. Once you have set up an account on one of those services, use the mobile browser to navigate to www.cryptostrikers.com to play the game.
